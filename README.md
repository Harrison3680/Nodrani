> Nodrani was a [Discord](https://discord.com) Bot by [Ricky](https://github.com/RickyDana06). Nodrani was made originally in the app [BDFD](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jakubtomana.discordbotdesinger), Then being change over to a javascript version called [DB-Script](https://www.db-script.xyz).

## Hosting

## Packages and more
THe following are required for Nodrani to work
```
    "discord.js": "^12.2.0", //MUST BE 12.2.O!!!
    "discordbot-script": "^2.0.5", //This can be updated to latest, But some commands may break!
```

## .env
Create a file called `.env`, Input the following
```
TOKEN=token here // This is the bot token. keep it private!
PREFIX1=$getServerVar[prefix] // You can change this to whatever, but it's suggested to keep the way it is!
PREFIX2=<@bot id> // This is so PC users can ping the bot as a prefix
PREFIX3=<@!bot id> // This is so mobile users can ping the bot as a prefix
```
